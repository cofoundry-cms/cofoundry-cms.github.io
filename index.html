                    <h3>Tools you know</h3>
                    <p>Cofoundry is there when you want it and gets out of your way when you don't. Get back to writing regular .Net code you love and enjoy complete freedom with your front-end technology and designs.</p>

                    <h3>Flexible to your needs</h3>
                    <p>Every application is different. Cofoundry is supported by a rich plugin architecture that let's you swap in your prefered tools and components or scale up your architecture when you need it.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Customize and extend</h3>
                    <p>DI is at the heart of Cofoundry which makes it really easy to override any implementation. Plugins are easily installed via Nuget, but itâ€™s also simple to inject your own custom implementation.</p>

                    <h3>Built to serve</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>CMS administration interfaces are often built to serve both developers and users which leads them to be complicated and full of jargon. Cofoundry uses a code-first development approach which allows us to optimize both the developer and user experience without having to compromise on either.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Designed by UX professionals, the content administration interface is clean and simple to use. Inline content editing makes it easy to visualize changes, while form fields are decorated with help descriptions to assist data entry. Roles and permissions can be used to lock down features and hide them from users that don't need to see them.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Like the rest of Cofoundry, the administration interface is also extensible. Built using the popular Angular framework, custom modules or components can be fully integrated into the interface to give your custom functionality a consistent look and feel.</p>

                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Cofoundry is aimed at developers who love to code and be productive using .Net. We want you to spend less time implementing boring boilerplate code and give you more time to do the work you enjoy and provide value to your clients. We acknowledge diversity in development methodologies and project scope and endeavor to provide a tool set that you feel empowered by rather than restricted by.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p class="intro">Whilst we could describe Cofoundry as a CMS, content management is really just one component in a more fundamental toolset. We aim to keep everything opt-in, so you can just take what you need.</p>
